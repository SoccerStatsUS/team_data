* CITY TO HAVE BIG LEAGUE SOCCER THIS SEASON

* While no announcement is made by the division and will hardly be forthcoming before the meeting of the American League magnates, it is believed that it will be something like 80-20, with the visiting club receiving the short end.
* The American League, however, has profited by that experience and the conditions are such that disappointments cannot prevail. To assure good faith in honoring the schedule and to finish the season, every club is compelled to deposit a forfeit of $500. In addition there are fines provided for where there is the least infraction of the rulings. All of which mans that when clubs are scheduled to play the team will have to appear intact and with their regular lineups.
