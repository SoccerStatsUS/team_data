*The Bethlehem Steel Company soccer team, undisputed champions of America, have established a record never before equaled in this country. Bethlehem has won the American Cup three seasons in succession and have four legs on the trophy which gives them ore than any other team among the cup winners. The Steel Workers are also t he only team in the country to win the National and American Cups both in one season. Two years ago they achieved the duplicate distinction and as they repeated this season, this gives the team the right to be considered the strongest team in the country.
*The only teams to defeat the Steel Workers during the last season was Disston F. C., of Philadelphia, and the West Hudsons, both in the National League.
*
*The points scored by Bethlehem against those by opponents really indicates how far the Steel Workers outclassed their opponents and it was only toward the close of the season that they were compelled to extend themselves to their utmost to retain the honors. The Bethlehem team scored 104 points to 21 by opponents.
*
*Of the players, Harry Ratican was the biggest point getter, locating the net 28 times in 22 games. "Whitey" Fleming was close second with 24 goals and Pepper third with 13.

*Last night at the Sun Inn, the Bethlehem Steel soccer team held its annual banquet, and a thoroughly enjoyable evening was spent. A sumptuous repast was provided by the Sun Inn management, after which Toastmaster Harry Carpenter called on H. E. Lewis for a speech. Mr. Lewis replied by reviewing the season just closed and complimented the team on their great showing and especially on the gentlemanly way they took their one and only defeat of the year, the national cup final. He also paid a sincere tribute tot he memory of the late Harry Trend, and all present who knew the deceased intimately realized more than ever the sterling quality of the friend who had passed from their midst.
*Toastmaster Carpenter then called for speeches from all present and some latent oratorical talent came to light. The efforts of Bobby Morrison and "Ordie" McKelvey were especially commendable.
*Those present were: H. E. Lewis, Harry Carpenter, L. W. Lewis, B. Horsfall, J. Machen, W. Duncan, J. Ferguson, G. McKelvey, W. Forrest, P. Butler, H. Ratican, T. Fleming, F. Pepper, M. Chadwick, J. Easton, J. Campbell, J. Wilson, R. Morrison, T. Murray, S. Fletcher, W. Kirkpatrick, and W. Sheridan.

* Thomas E. Murray marries
* Both young people have hosts of friends in the Bethlehems. Mr. Murray is employed in No. 4 machine shop at the Steel plant, and is a star player at right halfback on the champion soccer team. He was chosen a year ago to play the same position on the American soccer team that went to Norway and Sweden to demonstrate this country's efficiency in the game. Mr. Murray put up a great game abroad.

* Fred Pepper, the hard working inside right, was elected captain for the 1917-1918 season of the Bethlehem Steel Company soccer tame and J. Ferguson, left fullback, as sub-captain. This combination ought to pilot the locals to more laurels in the soccer world.
* "Jimmy" Murphy, the former Brown University and New Bedford star, will be seen shortly in the Steel Workers' lineup at outside right.
Hardy at inside left for the Steel Workers showed flashes of real football against the Veterans Saturday and ought to be a good asset to the Blue and White when he is familiar with their style of play.
* The strength of the halfback line has always been a feature in the play of the Bethlehem team.

Fifty-four clubs have entered for the trophy this season, compared with 88 last year, the falling off being due to several clubs having disbanded owing to the war.

* On Saturday, Oct. 13, the Babcock & Wilcox team of Bayonne will play the Steel Workers in the second game of the National League, on the new athletic field. In the Babcock lineup will be seen some of the best soccer players in the east, especially the forward line. Bob Millar, formerly of Bethlehem, plays center forward for the visitors, and local soccer fans are aware of the brand of soccer he is capable of furnishing. Captain Muir at inside right is another player of the individual type, and with men like Sweeney and Gaynor on the left wing, the Bethlehem defense will have their first real test of the season.

* http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl101017.html
*A big crowd is expected to be on hand Saturday at the soccer game between Babcock & Wilcox and the Bethlehem Steel. The "Babs" are certainly capable of extending the Steel Workers and Saturday's game ought to be a hummer.
*Tommy Murray the crack right half back of the Steel Workers is on the injured list with a badly injured knee. This will necessitate a change in the half back line.
*The work of the inside forwards last Saturday was of such an order that it will take exceptional ability to displace any of the men who played against the Jersey A. C.
*Sanny Todd, the former Queens Park full back is rapidly rounding into shape and will make his debut shortly for the Steel Workers.

* The sixteen-player limit rule inaugurated by the Eastern district should help soccer in the future. It will prevent the strong teams from signing up players they don't intend to play and incidentally help the weaker teams to secure some of the surplus.

*Harry Ratican the center forward of the Steel Workers will be unable to play against New York Sunday owing to family bereavement.
*Jimmy Campbell the center half of the Steel Workers is playing a great game just now. Jimmy's great asset is his ability to think quicker than the other fellow.
*Tommy Murray will make an welcome reappearance on Sunday against New York. With Murray, Campbell and Kirkpatrick in the halfback line, the New York forwards will know they have been in a real game.
*Jimmy Easton, inside left, is at the top of his game at present, dribbling wonderfully and keeping sure-foot Fleming well supplied with opportunities.
*Captain Pepper and McKelvey are in good form just now. Pepper's aggressiveness and McKelvey's ability to cross the ball at opportune moments are a big factor in the Bethlehem success.

* On Sunday, March 17th, Bethlehem Steel will travel to Bayonne, to play the Babcock & Wilcox F. C. in a National League game. The Babs are exceptionally strong on their own grounds and have been greatly strengthened since their defeat here. Neil Clarke and Jack Lance, two former Bethlehem Steel stars, are now in the Bab's lineup and have added greatly to the strength of their defense. However, the Steel Workers are in great form just now and e very man is aware that to drop one point in the league will be almost fatal to their chances of winning the championship so that the Babs can be assured of a strenuous contest.

The Steel Workers are now entering upon the most strenuous period of the season. National League games, American Cup games, and National Cup games follow one another with such regularity that there is no possibility of letup. However, the physical condition and morale of the team is such that the management feels confident that the men will be able to keep up their wonderful stride and land the three championships for the Bethlehems.

The fight for the National League pennant looks like a struggle between Paterson F. C. and Bethlehem Steel. Both teams have lost one game, but Paterson has protested the game they lost to New York F. C. and if the protest is sustained and they are successful in the replay the Steel Workers will have a bit task on hand to win the championship. Advices from Bayonne would seem to indicate that the Steel Workers are in for a great game with the Babs on Sunday, but with the local team playing with the same dash and determination as featured the last few games they have played they ought to add two more points to their list.

* Unable to get together a representative team, the Jersey A. C. forfeited their National League game Saturday to the West Hudsons.

* Of the 45,000 soccer players registered in this country last year, 18,000 of them have joined the colors. Over one thousand clubs have found it necessary to disband.

* At a special meeting of the National Challenge Cup Committee of the United States Football Association the principal business was the selection of the ground for playing off the Eastern semi-final for the National Challenge Cup. Pres. Thomas Bagnall presided. Other members present were: Thomas W. Cahill, secretary; Andrew M. Brown, (Bayonne), and Joe Booth, (Bridgeport). After considering the bid of $825, less expenses, from the West Hudsons for Clark's Athletic Field, Newark, the committee decided to accept the Fall River Rovers' net guarantee of $700 for the tie to be played at Fall River on April 13. This was agreed upon for the benefit of the large crowd who will see one of the most bitterly contested cup ties in the annals of soccer football in America. In the event of the Fall River Rovers being successful in their semi-final against the West Hudsons the final tie will be played in the New England district on April 27; but if the West Hudsons emerge winners the final will be staged in New York on April 28.

*At a meeting of the American Football Association in Newark, Saturday night, the Bethlehem Steel Co. soccer team, holders of the famous trophy, were drawn to play against Disston A. A., of Tacony, in the semi-final game. The match will be played at Bethlehem on or before Saturday, April 20. The winner of the fourth round game between Fore River Rovers and Fall River Rovers will play the Babcock & Wilcox team of Bayonne, N. J., the other semi-final game. No date has been set for the later game, but the Jersey team will have to travel to the field of the New England club which wins.

*Well Wallyum Duncan didn't get much to do, but he showed class and grit when called upon.
*Silent John Ferguson was as cool and deliberate as ever, always a bulwark in a pinch.
*Big Sam Fletcher played the game of his life and used his weight a la Crompton. Ask Tommy Swords.
*T. E. Murray, Bethlehem's internationalist, took good care of his former teammate in Sweden, Tommy Swords, and the latter somehow missed the limelight.
*Well, Dribbler Campbell was Dribbler Campbell. Nuf sed.
*Billy Kirkpatrick was so busy he didn't have time to smile. His grit and tenacity earned him many friends.
*Little Jimmy Murphy's speed was too much for the Rovers' defense. At that he was playing against the cleverest and best players on the Rovers' team Charles Burns.
*Pepper, the tireless, got in enough hard work to do an ordinary man for a week, and he still had pep at the finish.
*Didn't Harry Ratican bustle those fullbacks, yet he showed the Bethlehem spirit when he always let the goal keeper clear if he got the ball first.
*Unfortunate not to score, some of Forrest's drives had goal labeled on them. His was a wonderful debut.
*Whitey Fleming had a regular field day. Fred Burns had a wonderful view of the game he will never forget -- Tommy's heels. He saw them most of the time.
*The big Bethlehem delegation certainly enjoyed themselves. They had the satisfaction of seeing the Steel Workers give the most wonderful exhibition of soccer in their history. It's hard to imagine a time in the final so much outclassed as the Rovers were.
*Sunday's great victory will not make the Steel Workers let up for a minute. They will tackle Babcock & Wilcox next Saturday in the American Cup final with the same dash and determination that made them the United States champion.
*Just one word for the Rovers; they took their defeat like good sports, Captain Swords and Charles Burns congratulating the Steel Workers and admitting that they were outclassed.

*The United States Football Association will meet Friday evening in Pittsburgh to decide a protest entered by Paterson F. C. against Player Ferro of the New York F. C. Paterson claimed that Ferro was ineligible to play in the game they lost to New York F. C. The decision of the committee will practically decide the final standing in the National League. At present time both Bethlehem and Paterson have lost two games and drawn one, with Paterson still having one more game to play with New York F. C. at Paterson. If Paterson is successful in the protest the best they can do is to tie Bethlehem for the championship, which will make a replay on neutral grounds necessary.

* Prospects for soccer next season are exceptionally bright. New leagues are being formed in different sections of the country, the shipbuilding yards and munitions plants realizing that the game is a great recreation for the spectators at a time when no other open air games can be played. The National League will be the premier in the east and will be composed of eight of the strongest clubs playing the game. Bethlehem Steel will be represented by an exceptionally strong team next season and several new players will be seen in the Bethlehem lineup. Soccer will receive an international tinge by the appearance this fall of a team representing Belgium. There is no doubt but that the National Champions will be their main opponent after a series of three games will be arranged.


*http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl071718.html
*This morning President E. G. Grace of the Bethlehem Steel Company presented each of the players of the victorious soccer team with a splendid gold watch as an appreciation of their efforts in bringing to the town three championships.
*The watches are fine specimens, are beautifully engraved as well as to bring out that the local team won the championship for the season 1914-15, 1915-16 and 1917-18.
*To show their appreciation of President Grace's generosity, the players in turn presented him with a national championship cup medal, properly inscribed.
*Besides the gold watches the National and American cup medals were also given to the players.
