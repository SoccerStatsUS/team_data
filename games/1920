*Steel Workers Trip to Brazil Certain
*According to an announcement made by Secretary Thomas W. Cahill of the United States Football Association, the invasion of the Bethlehem Steel team to Brazil is certain, the tour to start next month for a series of games in that country during September. The trip was arranged by Ambassador Morgan at Rio de Janeiro and local officials. Secretary Cahill yesterday stated that the sanction of the Federation Internationale de Football for the Bethlehem tour of Brazil had been granted in a cablegram just received from C. A. W. Hirschman of Amsterdam, F. I. F. Secretary-Treasurer. The National Commission of the U. S. F. A. is now taking a mail vote to grant permission to the Bethlehem team to make the trip. The games in Brazil will be played under the auspices of the Brazilian Federations of Sports, and will be six or eight in number. The team will sail for Rio from New York, and games will be played in Rio, Bahia, Pernambuco, Sao Paulo and Santos.
*
*Tour Was Originally Planned For Last Season
*The trip to Brazil is the completion of plans formulated last season and which according to the original idea was to have followed the Steel Workers campaigning in Sweden and Denmark. In fact, the players left Bethlehem assured that they would tour South America and were somewhat disappointed when a cablegram reached them on board ship while en route to the Scandinavian countries calling it off. With an extensive schedule to be played in Sweden and Denmark, it was deemed unwise to make the final leg of the trip until this year. The decision was a wise one for it is remembered that the season in this country was well started before the Bethlehem players returned and in the opening games the men did not display their usual form. It is understood that several new men are expected to join the squad and that they will be included among the players on the trip.
*
*St. Louis Club Will Also Tour
*An all-star selection to represent St. Louis will leave Toronto, Canada, tomorrow on a trip that will take them to Europe and practically over the identical rout traveled by the Bethlehem Club last season. They will sail for Havre, France, aboard the Canadian-Pacific liner Tunisian. The middle-west aggregation will be reinforced with a delegation of eastern players, included in the party at the request of the Swedish Association. The players are: George J. Tintle, of Harrison, N. J., and Albert Blakey, of Philadelphia, both members of the 1916 international team and who also made the trip abroad with the Bethlehem team last summer. David Brown of Kearny, N. J.., Harry J. Ratican, St. Louis-born star of the Robins Dry Dock team of Brooklyn, and for three seasons leading goal scorer of the United States, and George Post, late of the Erie A. A., of Kearny, N. J. John J. Heminsley, of Paterson, was to have made the trip, his third to Europe under Cahill's direction, but difficulties have arisen at the eleventh hour and it is probable Charles H. Ellis of Woodside, L. I., a member of the 1916 international team, will be substituted at the last minute.
*
*Third American Team to go to Europe
*The St. Louis team is the third to go to Europe for soccer competition in five years and is the first such to be composed entirely of American-born players. Sixteen of the members were born in St. Louis and it is under the name of the St. Louis Football Club that the team will play overseas. Five or six countries will be visited, the schedule not being completed by the Swedish Football Association taking in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Czecho-Slovakia, Holland and possibly Belgium.

Competition: National League

*http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl070220.html
*Industrial Soccer for National Title
*Dissatisfaction was general in the National Soccer League last season and it would be little surprise if many of the clubs, including Bethlehem, failed to compete in that circuit next season. An Industrial League threatens to take the place of the National League and already has been effected. Sanction to operate such a series was granted the American Industrial Athletic Association at a recent meeting of the United States Football Association held in St. Louis. A survey of the soccer activities during the last season shows that about thirty strong industrial teams were on the field but no effort was made to match them in national competition. The caliber of these teams compared well with not only the best soccer organizations in the country, but American Industrial teams invaded Canada and defeated the best clubs there. The A. I. A. A. cup series this year will bet he first of its kind ever attempted and will no doubt meet with the general approval of all those fostering the sport. The matches it is proposed to play in an elimination series in which all teams competing must e members of the organization and registered with the State Association affiliated with the N. S. A. F. M. A. A beautiful trophy has been selected by the Industrial directors to be awarded to the team winning the national title.

* NATIONAL SOCCER LEAGUE AHS BEEN REORGANIZED
*Merchants and Disston Teams Dropped Because of Violating Rules
*8 CLUBS TO PLAY NEXT YEAR
*Meeting Held Saturday at Newark and Important Questions Settled
*The dissatisfaction in the ranks of the National Soccer League was somewhat smoothed over at a meeting of the circuit held in Newark on Saturday night and after lengthy discussions, reorganization was effected for the campaign next year.
*
*Before the session convened there were many who somewhat feared that the league would go into the discard, several of the clubs expressing a desire to drop out, while others were averse to continue if one or two of the clubs that violated the rules during the campaigning last season continued.
*
*All discussion was, however, straightened out after lengthy squabbling and the league officials will go ahead minus two of the teams, together with the assurance that the rules would be more stringently enforced next year.
*
*The award of the honors to the Bethlehem Club was undisputed. The two teams dropped were Merchants and Disstons, these two teams behaving as they liked last year and frequently failed to honor scheduled engagements. In this Bethlehem was quite frequently the goat, one occasion being when Merchants refused to come here for a game and on the same day played an exhibition contest in Philadelphia.
*
*The officials apparently realized that the actions of these two clubs were a severe hold-back and detriment to the game and it was deemed advisable to reorganize the league without including the two teams.
*
*The league organized with eight teams, as follows: Bethlehem, New York F. C., Paterson F. C., Federal Ship, Robins Dry Dock and Morse Dry Docks. In granting permission to Federals to continue, they were warned that this would be their last chance in the event of again violating the rules.
*
*William Sheridan, manager of athletics at the local plant of the Bethlehem Steel Co., was the representative of the Bethlehem F. C. Mr. Sheridan gained the league's permission for a trip to Brazil with the understanding that upon the return of the team the players were to be allowed seven days' grace before starting their league schedule.

*H. E. LEWIS TO WED MISS HELEN SANDERS, OF ST. PAUL
*Mrs. J. Howard Sanders, of St. Paul, Minn., announced the engagement of her daughter, Miss Helen W. Sanders, to H. Edgar Lewis of Bethlehem, Pa. The wedding will take place early in fall.

* http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl072820.html
*Proposed Soccer Rules Changes
*The international board of Great Britain which governs the soccer football code, recently considered a proposition by Scotland that no player can be offside unless within twenty-five yards of the opposing goal. There was also a suggestion that no player can be offside at a free kick or a throw in. They are radical projects and the board ruling will be interesting even though it seems this country will not follow the lead of Great Britain in withdrawing from the International Federation

* The announced exhibition tour of the Bethlehem Steel soccer team will get under way on Sunday afternoon when the squad journeys to Harrison Field, N. J., to meet the Eries. Eliminated in the two cup competitions and with but few more games on the league schedule, Manager Sheridan is busy arranging a schedule of exhibition games in hopes of extending the season. Several of these contests will be played on the home lot. The game against the Eries should attract unusual attention for it was this clan that early in the season eliminated Bethlehem in the National Cup competition. Since then, however, the team has been traveling at a faster pace and local adherents are confident that the Bethlehems will avenge their cup defeat on Sunday.

*That the soccer fever has invaded adjoining cities and towns is indicated by the encouraging reports heard on the activities of this sport. Easton will be represented with soccer for the first time in years and apparently is going at it strong, for a league has been organized that will carry eight clubs. The management wants to conduct the game strictly "according to Hoyle" and had a representative come to Bethlehem relative to affiliating with the Bethlehem & District Soccer Association. This does not mean that the teams will be included with those represented in the league. They will conduct their own league but the games will be under strict regulation. With nine clubs identified with the Bethlehem & District League in this city and eight in Easton, it increases the total of minor teams in this second to 17. It is also likely that Allentown will take a tip and follow suit by organizing a league.

*Great News for Steel Management
*The fact that this locality promises to be a hot-bed for soccer should be good news for the management of the Bethlehem Steel Club for it was really the Bethlehem Steel that introduced the sport in this section of the country. For some reason, interest in the game lagged but promises to be greatly stimulated by the increased activity. In order to present a representative team, the Steel Workers were forced to import most of the players. However, one of the officials expressed himself as much rather favoring the selection of local players and stated that whenever they showed promise of developing they would be signed with the big club. With the extensive campaigning this season, it would, therefore, cause little surprise if some of the sand-lotters were given a chance with the big Bethlehem team next year.

* CAHILL'S RESIGNATION IS A BIG SURPRISE IN SOCCER WORLD

* "This is the most surprising piece of news soccerdom has had since it was made into an organized sport mainly through Cahill's efforts eight years ago. He has been the honorary secretary of the organization since its formation and has guided it though its battles and troubles with a firm hand."

* "Soccer football has long been in the eye of some of the baseball managers, notably Charlie Comiskey, of the White Sox, as a means of utilizing their parks in the winter time, and Cahill, in announcing his resignation from the U. S. F. A. said he intended to devote his time to organizing a national league of professional soccer teams, and while he has not yet announced his plans, it is probable he has been going into the matter with the baseball people."

* "Ed Cochems, who as director of athletics achieved national fame by his development of the forward pass the first year that play was legalized in college football, has also been working on the soccer proposition, and he too thinks that game has a bright future. Its biggest handicap has always been the lack of suitable playing fields, and if proper terms can be made with the baseball magnates, this problem will be solved."


* Eight years ago? Founding of the USFA?

* A big crowd showed up in striking contrast to the mere corporal's guard that turns out to witness the games of the steel Workers, irrespective of the caliber of the opposition. Bethlehem has been honored with the soccer championship of the United States on four occasions in the past six years but despite this glowing tribute brought home by the Bethlehem aggregation, together with the fact that the Bethlehem Steel field was the scene of some of the greatest soccer tilts staged in this country, the largest attendance at a home game was but a little more than half of the 9,000 who turned out to see the Robins-Erie clash. As a rule, the attendance hovers in the hundreds with a few exceptions, one of which was the game between Bethlehem Steel and Brooklyn Celtics in the final round of the National Cup at Lehigh field, when 6,000 turned out to see the game. It was believed that with Bethlehem proving greatly superior to all other opponents during the years the championship was annexed, that the rudiments of the game were devoid of any spectacular or brilliant playing and that once the ability of the team was reduced to an equal of their opponents local interest would be greatly stimulated. This, however, has appeared to have had little effect on the enthusiasm of the sporting inclined in Bethlehem, for this year, with contenders proving equal to the home clan, there has been little difference noted in the usual number of fans in attendance. It is hoped by those who have fostered soccer in Bethlehem for years, giving this city the distinction of supporting one of the first big soccer teams in the country, that spirit and interest will be developed similar to that indicated in the Robins-Erie game, when 9,000 persons turned out to cheer their respective favorites to victory

* Former Steel Workers With the Robins
Five former Steel Workers were in the Robins' lineup and all of the acquitted themselves well, with Neil Clark being the most prominent with clever defensive work when the pressure was the hardest. The other Bethlehemites were Sundberg, McKelvey, Sturch and Ratican. The latter was responsible for the Robins' only goal, scoring by the display of aggressiveness that has made him famous. The ball was dropped between the fullbacks and Ratican rushed in and breasted the ball into the net, with both fullbacks desperately attempting to hold him off.
