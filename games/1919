The sod had been lifted in arranging for the opening of the baseball season and the infield was pretty well soaked from the rain. Rather than take a chance of cutting up the field, it was deemed advisable to call off the contest.

* Harry "Lefty" Nolan, center forward of Merchant F. C. of Harriman, Pa., was given his release by Manager Bedford after the game with Bethlehem yesterday afternoon. Nolan, who was left out of the lineup against Bethlehem, has been one of the most consistent scorers this season for the shipbuilders. Since the opening of the season "Lefty" has averaged one goal each game.

* The growth of the kicking style of football is shown by the 1,800 to 1,900 registered players enjoying membership in the territory embraced in the Eastern Pennsylvania and District Association. Those registered are in the open leagues such as the Allied, Industrial, Boys' Clubs and the Bethlehem & District Football Association League. The cricket clubs, college and school teams are not included in the enrollment of soccer. The children of Bethlehem are taking up the sport with greater vigor than ever and recently in describing the activities and knowledge of the game displayed by them, a well-known English soccer enthusiast who has had the pleasure of seeing some of the biggest games in this country paid them a compliment in remarking "Those kids in a few more years are going to be real players."

* Fear Millar's Soccer Career Ended
* (Millar would play 10 more years.)

* http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl022720.html
* National League Schedule May be Dropped
* Although not official, it is hinted by pretty good authority that the Bethlehem F. C. management is contemplating dropping out of the National league race and directing its attention solely to the two cup competitions. This move is prompted by the many postponements and is probably found necessary so that schedules can be completed without extending too far into the baseball season. There is little chance in doubling up on the schedule like in other sports for the simple reason that to do so would mean flirting with disaster in the important meets. Anyhow, the National Leagues is only a side runner to the cup competitions, the National leading with the American holding a close second. No sane manager would allow his team to double on a schedule by playing a league game on a Saturday and following with an important cup clash the following day. It might be a wise move of the management if under the conditions the National league games were dropped and when playing again becomes possible concentrate all efforts on the cup competitions. If one club takes this action, there is little doubt but that the others will follow.

*Soccer Association Had a Meeting
*Although weather conditions have made soccer games impossible for the last eight weeks, the ice covered fields did not prevent the moguls of the United Football Association of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from getting toothier for a confab and such a session was held in Philadelphia last night. This is the district in which the Bethlehem & District League is am ember and the local crowd was represented at the meeting by its secretary, J. Harry Carpenter. The latter is becoming more active than ever in soccer circles where in addition to presiding in a number of important games thus far this season he is also guiding the destinies of the local minor organizations. The new name recently adopted by the former Blue Mountain Soccer League was officially sanctioned last night. IN addition to brining up this matter, Mr. Carpenter introduced a motion , which was carried, instructing the national committee to appoint a neutral linesman for all national cup matches. It also become apparent that the association will not stand for any abusive language to the referees in the future. (This was noted when two players were suspended for six months for resorting to such tactics.

*Games Almost Certain For Saturday
*Barring rain, snow, sleet and zero weather during the week, the Bethlehem Steel F. C. is almost certain to take up its season's campaigning where it was left off almost nine weeks ago. This is the longest period ever that the team was forced to idleness and the players as well as the fans were itching for a good red hot contest. The small army of loyals who for several weeks have been battling the snow and ice have at last conquered the elements and barring any more inclement conditions during the week, "Billy" Sheridan feels certain that the playing space of the field can be rounded into condition for a setto on Saturday. The Wanderers, a Philadelphia, will be the attraction in a National Cup game.

* http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl031120.html
* Baseball or Soccer
* The directors of the athletic activities at the Bethlehem Steel Co. plant are confronted with a rather perplexing proposition. They have to decide whether the athletic field will be retained for soccer purposes until all the campaigning is completed or will the grounds be given over to baseball. It's a cinch that if the National and American Cup competitions and National League schedule are carried out in full, the booting adherents will be right in the midst of a heated argument up to May 1 and probably several weeks thereafter. The baseball schedule calls for the first home game on Many 1. In view of this the turf should be lifted and the diamond laid out at least two weeks before the opening date to get the grounds into condition and allowing sufficient time for the players to get in a couple licks of good practice. Fortunately there is another diamond that might be available in case the soccer activities are continued into the baseball season and it would be no surprise if the opening Steel League games were played in Taylor Stadium.

* Local fans who expect to travel to Brooklyn to see the Robins Dry Dock vs. Bethlehem Steel game on Sunday next are requested to notify Wm. Sheridan at Bethlehem Steel Athletic office, Telephone No. 222, so that arrangements can be made for reservations. Todds field, where the game will be played, will be taxed to its full capacity long before the game starts, so that notice of reservations must be given to the officials in charge not later than Friday.
* Great excitement prevails in the Robins camp in connection with the coming game with the champions and betting is heavy. The Robins are undergoing special training for the game. They know they will have the hardest game of the season when they clash with the Steel Workers and will leave nothing undone in the way of preparation for the game.

* Soccer Players Preparing to Vacate
*Several weeks ago a quartet of Scotchmen, heralded as finds in soccerdom, arrived in New York and immediately after receiving their clerance in quarantine, journeyed to Bethlehem, where they reported to the Bethelehem Steel management. With the arrival of these men soccer hopes went soaring sky high and it was generally beleived that with the addition of these men to the championship squad, Bethlehem would have little trouble in again annexing National honors. Something apparently went wrong for it is understood that only one of the four displayed form up to expectations, with one other showing possibiliteis able to compete with the men already under contract. The other two it is believed were hopelessly outclassed by the players Manager Sheridan had under contract. The four were given a try out in practice games, after which it was said efforts had been made to sign only two of them. Corrigan, one of the quartet appeared in the game against the Robins at Brooklyn on Sunday afternoon. Now the rumor is prevalent that the other three are preparing to pull stakes and seek other hunting grounds. Morse Dry docks, probalbly a more bitter rival to the Robins than Bethlehem, it is said is urging the men to join their clan.

*http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl040920.html
*Another Player Reported Leaving
*Thore Sundberg, the Swede, who joined the Bethlehem Club shortly after the return from the tour in the Scandinavian countries, is getting ready or has already drawn up stakes and decamped for other quarters. Sundberg looked good in Sweden and when he came to America chose Bethlehem for his abode it was believed that he would prove a valuable asset to the team. The form he displayed in this country, however, was not up to standard and after given a tryout in several of the less important games was assigned to the reserves. Apparently this inactivity did not appeal to the Swede. Chicago is the city it is said he is heading for and will located in a Swedish colony which is represented by a soccer team.
*Harris to Leave, Also a Rumor
*If the rumor heard materializes the Bethlehem club will receive a severe blow in the loss of Harris, the crack center forward. Efforts to verify his leaving were not available at this time and it is hoped the talk may prove to be nothing more than idle chatter. From what is heard, Harris, for some reason or other, favors the Canadian climate and is preparing to return there. There is little doubt that he intended to locate here permanently, as it is understood that he hand his furniture transferred to this city. The furniture, it is said, was returned to Canada without unloading. Many soccer followers believe that his change of attitude was probably agitated by the shift in the Bethlehem lineup in the Robins game. In that contest, Harris, a crack center forward who has sent many shots crashing into the net, was transferred to a wing position, while Corrigan, a half back, was given the forward berth.
*Fall River Hard After Title
*Having eliminated Bethlehem in the fifth round National Cup competition, the Robins Dry Dockers will stage their next campaign on Coats Field, Pawtucket, R. I., tomorrow afternoon against the Fore River Football Club. The game is the semi-final in the competition, the winners of which will meet the western delegation in the final. "Billy" Sheridan, trainer of the local clan, it is said is visiting the Quincy, Mass., the home of the Fore River Club, and although it is highly probable that he is sojourning in that city on a business jaunt, many believe that his mission is quite to the contrary and that he is lending his aid in priming the Fore River crowd for the Robins game.

*Soccer Clubs Likely to Get the Pink Slip
*When the moguls of the National League gather this evening in Newark, N. J., to discuss soccer business they are sure to hear some rather stiff arguments from the Bethlehem end of the circuit. “Billy” Sheridan, local representative will be among those in attendance and some of the things “Billy” will have to say are quite likely to start a rumpus. Teams in the National League this year have played Bethlehem for the “goat" on more than one occasion and chances are that when the clubs are drawn for next season several will find themselves on the outside. Federals, Interborough Rapid, Merchants and Disston are four clubs that did not live up to the schedule of games and if not dropped are certainly to draw a severe reprimand.

* A mere handful of soccer fans, a crowd not near befitting the excellent reputation established by the Steel Workers were gathered in Bethlehem Steel field on Saturday afternoon. A good many sports followers apparently did not realize the importance the honors garnered by the Steel Workers and that they have given Bethlehem a berth among the list of American champions. However, what the crowd lacked in number was fully made up in enthusiasm and it is doubtful if ever the players were cheered more lustily. The effect of this encouragement was plainly visible on the layers for their response was a style of play with greater determination.

*Appeared Against Their Former Teammates
*Three or four weeks ago the Bethlehem soccer clan was increased by the addition of four members who reported to the club immediately upon their arrive to this country from Scotland.. One of the players remained while the other three deserted and joined forces with the Morse Dry Docks contingent. Yesterday afternoon two of them, Galloway and McLoughlin, playing inside left and outside right, respectively, appeared in the Morse lineup against Bethlehem in the game in which the champions were held to a scoreless tie. These players had been located in the Morse plant hardly a week before they jumped into harness. The loss of the three players together with the absence of Sundberg who is vacationing in Chicago and Harris, who is returning to Canada, has somewhat depleted the ranks of the Steel Workers and it is noticed by their lineup yesterday that Fred Pepper, released a short time ago with "Bobby" Morrison, must have been re-instated.

*"Billy" Sheridan, representing the Bethlehem F. C., journeyed to Newark, N. J., last night to fight the claim for the game and enter protest against Federal Ship F. C., of Newark, N. J., who failed to appear for their contest with Bethlehem in the fourth round American Cup competition scheduled to be played on the Steel Company athletic field. The best Sheridan received, however, was the information that the alibi presented by the Federals was accepted and that the replay would have to be staged. Saturday was the date set for the contest so that new Bethlehem in order to enter the semi-finals will have to defeat the Federals. Before leaving for Newark to attend the meeting Sheridan was confident that the least the Bethlehem club could expect would be the game by forfeit and intended pressing action demanding the punishment of the Federal management and players for their failure to appear here. However, after the details were made known and evidence produced to substantiate them, it developed that the officials of the American Football Association were at fault. The Federals claimed that their notification to play Bethlehem was received too late to muster together the team. When the notice came, most of the players had left to spend the holiday season at their homes. Special effort was made to call them back, and seven of the players were on hand at the station to make the trip when it was decided to call it off. Substantiating these facts, the A. F. A., contended that they were at fault and ordered the replay on Saturday.

The field is covered with snow and ice and only an exceptional thaw will make the ground playable.
