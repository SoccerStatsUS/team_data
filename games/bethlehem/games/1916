*The American Football Association met last night in the Continental Hotel, Newark, N. J. Duncan Carswell, president of the association, was appointed delegate in charge of the game at Bethlehem on Saturday, by Disston, Philadelphia, and Bethlehem Steel Co., in the second round of the American Cup series. David M. White, Brooklyn, will referee. The game must start at 2:45 p.m.
*The Disston management has gotten together one of the strongest aggregations of soccer stars in the history of that club . IN goal, they have Pierce, considered by many the best goalkeeper in the east; McLaughlin and Small, fullbacks without doubt two of the best in the Philadelphia district; Dutcher at right half, is a young dashing player and a comer; Fisher at center half, is a veteran who formerly played with the West Philadelphia team, he is a heady player; Fullerton, who fills left halfback, is an old partner of Fisher, on the West Philadelphia team, and these two players work well together; Coursey and Barrett, the right wing, were members of the Hibernians last year, they are both fast aggressive players and will give the Bethlehem defense many anxious moments.
*Lynch, the new center forward, recently obtained by Disston from Canada, is quoted as one of the best finds of the season. The inside left position seems a little uncertain but it is expected that either Rodgers or McEwan will play there as both are extremely good men. Andrews at outside left is sure to cause a lot of trouble and is a very dangerous man near goal.
*The members of the local team are training hard and all the members are in good shape with the exception of Ratican who is still suffering because of a wrenched knee and will probably be out of the game for two or three weeks.

Great interest is being show in the coming American championship game between henry Disston and Sons, Philadelphia, and the Bethlehem Steel company. Disston at present leads the American League of Philadelphia, having won all games so far in that competition. Reports from Tacony state that the Disston management contemplates running a special train to Bethlehem on Saturday.
Word was received from Chicago that the big game scheduled between Bethlehem Steel and the pick of Chicago, for Saturday, December 23, will be played on Stagg field, Chicago University or the Chicago White Sox ball grounds.
St. Louis fans are looking forward to the visit of the national champions at Christmas and the fact that the St. Louis teams have never been defeated by an eastern team in the last eleven years makes the coming games between Bethlehem Steel company and St. Louis interesting and will no doubt draw record gates.
David M. White who will officiate as referee on Saturday, is rated as one of the most efficient members of the New York Referee's Association and handles most of the big games.
It is quite possible that the steelworkers will play in Wilmington and Baltimore during the holidays.

* Tom Cahill, one of America's greatest soccer enthusiasts thinks Neil A. Clarke, of the champion Bethlehem Steel company soccer team, the king of center halfbacks. Following the recent visit of the local team to the West, the St. Louis Times published the following:
* Stars of today and the past in soccer were discussed by Cahill during his visit. He went far back in praising the heroes and picked out John Finnegan of St. Louis, for his argument. Finnegan for years won the nickname of "King" because at center halfback he was hailed the peer of his position and according to Cahill "King" wore the crown until Clarke of Bethlehem came along.
* "The only player who steps in front of "King" Finnegan in my opinion is Clarke, who played here with Bethlehem," remarked Cahill. "We all know what a marvel John was, but I believe Clarke is a bit better than "King." Clarke surpasses Finnegan in reaching a ball with his head. In Clarke we have the greatest center half soccer has produced in years and years."

One of the "Hibs" new men will be John Lance the well-known local amateur who will play center forward against the champions.

* Despite reports to the contrary, several clubs in New York and Newark, N. J., are anxious to be given a franchise in the proposed Eastern Soccer League. As it is the intention of those behind the movement to admit not more than two clubs from each city, indications point to some of the magnates being disappointed when the time comes for handing out the plums. Bethlehem, National and American soccer champions, has signified its intention of joining the new league, while the Hibernians, of Philadelphia, the new Philadelphia Club, or probably Disston's will be considered when franchises are awarded. With a compact league, with cities like New York and Newark, where Sunday ball can be played, the organizers predict that the movement will be a huge success.

* Already a committee from the St. Louis Soccer League, the professional organization, is in the field trying to arrange for a renewal of the lease on Robinson Field but with Secretary Seekamp in Texas and the reorganization of the club in progress, there has been no chance to accomplish anything so far. The haste in trying to secure the grounds is undoubtedly caused by talk of two of the big corporations around St. Louis, the Wagner Electric plant, in St. Louis, and the American Steel Company, of Granite City, following the lead of the Bethlehem Steel Company and other big Eastern corporations in putting teams in the field. With the Pullman Company building a big plant at St. Louis there is also likelihood of a team from that company. This company has always been strong in promoting soccer, and at times has had one of the crack teams of the country.

* As the champion Bethlehem soccer team has been handing out defeats to every team that has opposed them in the different competitions in which they have taken part, as well as during their invasion of the Western States, a proposition has been made that the All-American team of the New York Protective Footballers' Association be pitted against the apparently invincible steelworkers.
* The American boys captured the honors in the international series last season, and, with practically the same combination, are hot favorites to repeat this year.
* Tommy Waldron of the Jersey A. C., who looks after the interests of the American team, and Harry Trend manager of the Bethlehems, talked the matter over at a recent social session following the Bethlehem-Hudson game in Newark. If the necessary permission can be secured through the United States Football Association, Mr. Waldron feels quite confident that the heroes of the international series would be quite willing and anxious to visit Bethlehem to meet the champions. He also states that the individual members of the team have expressed delight at the prospect of having an opportunity of testing the strength of the "champs."

*Notes. Easton a new man recently signed by Bethlehem will make his first appearance in tomorrow as a partner to Fleming. Easton came here from St. Louis where he had been playing on the famous St. Leos team of that city.
*No word has been received from the management of the Ben Miller Club professional champions of St. Louis, in answer to the offer made that club by Bethlehem, Disston and Newark for a series of games to be played in the East around the Easter holidays. The Eastern clubs were willing to give the Mould City team a guarantee of $1,000 with a privilege of the gate receipts and this offer was wired to them on Monday but up to date they have failed to accept same. This is a better offer than that made to the Bethlehem club a short time ago for a series out in St. Louis as Bethlehem could not get the percentage privilege.

* Word received from Fall River indicates that the Spndletown players are leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to win the championship this year. The mayor of the city himself started a fund to enable the Fall River players to lay off from work, and they have been in training, as a result, for the past ten days
