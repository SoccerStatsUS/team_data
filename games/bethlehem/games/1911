* 10/6/1911
* The Bethlehem soccer football team held a long and hard practice on Thursday afternoon on the East End field. The team had good training on Tuesday night and went through sprinting and long running. On Thursday afternoon the players were given ball practice. Today and Saturday the team will rest up for its hard battle with Reading, as everyone is aware of the last defeat sustained at the hands of the pretzelmen. The manager of the team is working hard building up a fast team for this town with such players as Galbraith, Stuart, Smith and Bone. Great things are expected. It was a clever deal by the management in securing the signatures of these four stars for an amateur team, thus making them eligible to play in amateur league football with the best of last year's players along with the new ones. Nothing should stop the winning streak which the team has started, seeing it has won the first two games of which last Saturday's was a pretty hard one. It was plain to be seen that the team was in good condition as it outplayed the Philadelphia club the last fifteen minutes of the game. A fast, keen game is expected, as this game marks the opening of the Eastern Pennsylvania League championship series, and a good crowd is expected to be on hand. With regret it is announced that the injury of Larlow, the inside left, which happened early in last Saturday's game, is more serious than at first anticipated, and he ill be out of the game for several weeks, which will make changes in the lineup necessary. The team against Reading on Saturday will be Carpenter, Bone, Stuart, Horsfall, Cassidy, Gribbon, Galbraith, Smith, Lewis, Williams and Leonard.
