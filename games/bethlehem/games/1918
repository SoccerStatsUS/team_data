* Persistent rumors that a good many of the Bethlehem soccer players having severed their connection with the local team to join shipyard teams has resulted in a general denial by William Sheridan, manager of athletics at the local plant. These rumors were more pronounced in Philadelphia and in ship building plants, where soccer has been chosen as one of the chief winter sports. Mr. Sheridan states that this is incorrect, as all the players who appeared in the National and American cup finals, which earned them the championships of the country, are employed at the plant and that the team will remain intact. It is further known that of the players in last year's squad at least eight of them have signed an agreement to stay with the team, while the others have also signified their intention of doing likewise, although they have not yet signed.

*It is also announced that the teams will again play in the National League the coming season besides joining and National and American cup tourneys, both of which are played on the lose and out plan. According to Manager Sheridan, there is little likelihood of any of the players being induced to leave Bethlehem to take up work in any of the shipbuilding plants especially as all the players were working on munitions and having been classified as such prevents them from being drafted. The Bethlehem management is also out to improve its team the coming season.

*The management is not content to start the season with the same eleven which so handsomely won both the National and American cups, besides capturing the runner-up position to Paterson in the National League series. Manager Sheridan claims that Bethlehem already has its hooks out for several new players who are stars in their respective positions.

*With such good prospects at Bethlehem, coupled with the fact that it is probable that the team will be even stronger than last season, soccer should hold its own the coming season despite present conditions. So confident is Bethlehem of presenting a strong eleven that negotiations are already being made for the purpose of playing the touring Belgium soccer team a game or a series of games for the championship of the United States, when the Belgians tour this country early in the fall.

*That some of the shipbuilding plants are determined to go into soccer on an extensive scale and will not confine their playing to the shipyard league to be organized, is revealed by the progress made by the Soccer Association of the Merchant Ship at Bristol, Pa. This organization has been quietly organizing its teams and now comes forth with the announcement that the plant is to be represented by two teams, one to participate in the National League and the two cup competitions and the other in competition among the shipyard teams.

*Weeks ago rumors were current that scouts from the various shipyard sections had invaded this territory as well as other territory where soccer reigned the previous year and years before that. It was also said that overtures have been made to several local players, members of the Bethlehem championship team, but that the scouts were unsuccessful in luring the players to the shipyards. The fact that the Merchants now spring on the public two fully organized teams with no doubt a dozen or more second string men for e3ach, would indicate that these rumors had more than ordinary significance to them.

*Only recently Manager Sheridan of the Bethlehem soccer team was asked to verify rumors that were especially prevalent in Philadelphia to the effect that the majority of the players with the Bethlehem team last season had severed their local connection and were already signed up in the various shipyards. In response to the query Manager Sheridan replied that practically all of last season players would again wear the Bethlehem colors and as far as he knew not one had even made mention of being dissatisfied with the conditions here or the team they were playing with. Furthermore it is said that with the exception of two or three players, the rest have signed with Bethlehem for the coming season and are anxiously waiting for the ope3ning of the season.

*The draft together with voluntary enlistments have played havoc with a good many of the teams in the country and at the same time open up an avenue by which newly organized teams could secure the cream of the players. In many instances where only a half dozen more players remained for the team, the best of these players were lured to the shipyards and since the managers could be a bit choicy in their selections unusually strong teams have been organized. This means that the competition will be as strong if not stronger than last year and that the winners of the cups will not have easy sailing.

*The first team of the Merchants will comprise some of the best players in the country and will enter the National league in addition to the two cup competitions. This team will face Bethlehem and as all of the players have been in combat with the local aggregation with some team or other during the past season, they will be more or less familiar with the locals style of playing. Among the players signed by the Merchants Ship is Todd, who it is said was signed with Bethlehem and also played with Paterson, winners of the National League. Daniel Coursey, the former Hibernian-Disstons outside right and Scotty Wilson, also of Disstons. Harry Pearce who is playing second base for the Philadelphia Nationals, and who it is said intended joining the Steel Workers force, will tend goal for the National League team as soon as the Phillies finish the season.

*The opening game for the Merchant Ship will be played at Bristol August 31, when Bethlehem, National and American cup champions, will be the opponents in an exhibition game.
* http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl073118.html


*Announcement is made that "Tommy" Fisher, the former Disston center halfback, will play for the New York ship team in the Delaware River Soccer League the coming season. It was also stated that Fisher would captain the team, besides taking a hand in the developing of soccer at the New Jersey plant.

*Fisher was a star with the Disston team last season. The club was the most fortunate in games played against Bethlehem holding the champion Steel Workers to a tie in two games. He is a born soccer player, hailing from Greenock, the west of Scotland. For the last three years he sported the Disston colors and during that time did much to help place Disston in the leading ranks.

*"When the whistle blows for the opening soccer games of the season, there will be few changes if any in the championship Bethlehem team," says Manager Sheridan. It usually is policy to secure a few additional players each year to press into service in case of emergency, but according to Manager Sheridan all the players who were here last year will again try for a berth.

*Other players signed with the New York ship team are Aleck McLaughlin, the former Disston fullback; Johnny Ness, the goal keeper, and William Burrows, who played two years with Disstons and is also a former member of the Hibernians. It is also said that "Tommy" Swords, captain of the Fall River Rovers, finalists of the national cup competition last season, will be approached to play with the New York eleven.

*Nothing is left undone to make the industrial league equal in merits to the teams that play in the cup competitions. Present indications are that soccer will be more extensive the coming season than ever before and also that the competition will be much harder.

*Pusey & Jones soccer players started out in good form last Saturday by winning the five a side soccer tourney in conjunction with the Scottish games. Their victory last Saturday conclusively proves Pusey & Jones will be a strong factor in the shipyard league the coming season.

*A meeting of the Industrials will be held early next month, according to the announcement of Thomas Scott, secretary of the Industrial Soccer League. The circuit will be formed and arrangements made for the coming season.

*Disston will not be in the field next season unless a team is placed in the industrial league composed of the leading players at the saw works. The team was in the National League last year and toward the end of the season had trouble in keeping the players in tact, the call to the colors ravaging the lineup.

*L Thomas W. Cahill, secretary of the United States Football Association, reports that the game is making vast headway all over the country, which is a good indication that it is taking with the masses.

* With deep regret, although proud that one of their teammates is leaving to serve the colors, the Steel Workers bid farewell to Tommy Murray. Tommy was one of the most popular players on the team and his congenial spirit and always radiant smile will be sadly missed during the coming campaign. As a player Manager Sheridan will have a hard task in filling Murray's shoes. For four years he battled with the Steel Workers and was one of the hardest and best players on the field.

*When the championship Bethlehem Steel soccer team takes the field in the initial clash of the season several new players are likely to make their appearance with the squad. However, the main cog of the consistent soccer machine which for the past several years has represented the local plant will comprise the old players.
The launching of soccer in the various shipyards and munition manufacturing plants has kept scouts busy sweeping the country in an effort to lure star players into these plants. While in most instances publicity was widely given to the efforts of the representatives of these teams and their every move made known, Manager Sheridan of the local squad was busy in a quit manner securing players to bolster up probably week positions developing on his championship team. In this he was successful in securing two St. Louis players, conceded the best in the Middle West. The new players are James Brennigan, a left wing, either inside or outside, developed into a soccer player at Christian Brothers College, the same institution where Harry Ratican one of the star Bethlehem players, received his early training in the game. The other player signed is Bob Lancaster, a star player on the Ben Miller team, of St. Louis, last year, who while still a youngster, has had considerable experience in the game, having had his early training in England. With these two men signed Manager Sheridan has players he can inject into the affray at any time and feel confident they can uphold the playing standards established by the Steel Workers.

*In addition to being a soccer player of note, Brennigan is also considered a star baseball player and will no doubt be good material for the baseball season next year. Brennigan came here this week from the South where during the ball season he covered an infield position for the Jacksonville, Fla., club. He is 20 years of age and is conceded as being the youngest ball player that ever entered the major leagues., having been the property of the St. Louis Cardinals since he was 16 years old. After starring for Christian Brothers College in soccer games, Brennigan last year signed with the St. Leo team, one of the strongest soccer aggregation in St. Louis and all through the season played a brilliant game. Manager Sheridan was fortunate in securing the youngster and although he is not assigned to a regular position he is a good man to fall back on in case of injury to any of the players or any other emergency.

*For the position left vacant by the leaving of Tommy Murray, the star right halfback, who entered the service with a draft contingent, there are four players eligible who may be shifted to this position. Pepper, who can play a wonderful game at halfback, might be shifted to this position although Manager Sheridan may later decide that Fred will prove to a greater advantage in his old position. In that event "Bobby" Morrison, Lance and Butler will be the candidates who will work for Murray's place.

*Although practice has been in progress little more than a week the players are rounding out into excellent condition and in a short time will be fitted for the opening game. Lancaster and Brennigan worked out with the players on Saturday afternoon and both showed good form. The practice will continue regularly until the opening date.

*Just what prospects there are of staging one or two exhibition games before the league and cup season opens will depend on the schedule that will be arranged by the National league. This body will have a meeting in Newark, N. J., on Saturday at which time it is expected that the schedule will be arranged. Mr. Sheridan will represent the Bethlehem team at the meeting.


* James Brennigan, the twenty year old youngster, who less than two weeks ago came to Bethlehem, heralded as one of the cleverest soccer players ever turned out of St. Louis and also holding the distinction of being the youngest player ever signed by a Major league baseball club, left on Wednesday and is now reported to be among the Bristol players. When Brennigan came here he created quite a furor in soccer circles and local players who have been acquainted with his work on the soccer field predicted that he would earn a position on the championship Bethlehem club. They contended that due to his present ability in the game and his youth, he had all the earmarks of becoming one of the big stars of the game under the proper tutelage. In St. Louis, where he was a member of the St. Leo club, he established an excellent record and it was thought would be a strong addition to the Bethlehem club. In the several practice games with the Steel workers he made a good showing both in soccer and baseball but for some reason he was not signed, and it is said, decided to go to Bristol where he believed he was certain to make the team.

*Will the soccer game scheduled for next Saturday at the Bethlehem Steel Co. athletic field be canceled by virtue of the quarantine? Is a question soccer fans are asking. Since Bethlehem has established a quarantine as rigid if not more so than any other city in Pennsylvania, it's a foregone conclusion that unless conditions change quickly, the soccer contest will surely be barred, the same as all other public meetings.

* In speaking of the protest, Manager Sheridan is confident that the league officers will not uphold the Paterson club and that the charges brought were unwarranted. The contention is that cup games are to be given preference and when these contest are staged and league contests are to be played the following day, it is the privilege of the manager of any team to postpone the league game till a later date. It was also understood by Manager Sheridan that following the four weeks' postponement on account of influenza, no league games were to be played till notice had been served by the league secretary on all the clubs to resume playing.

Billy was an interested spectator at the game at Harriman yesterday afternoon and again made known that he had several connections with the championship aggregation. Should he be final in his intention, it is hardly likely that Kirkpatrick will return to the game this season, pending the release offered him by the Bethlehem management.

*Dick Spalding has signed for New York Ship, of Camden, N. J., and will assist that team in the first round of the National Cup tourney at Bethlehem, when the New Yorkers tackle Bethlehem.
*Merchant Ship Team B will have to take the field minus James Maxwell, one of the best inside lefts in the city, in their next few games. "Bill" injured his arm last week working on one of the ships, and is unable to use it.
*James Kerr, the former Thistle center halfback, and also a well-known referee, has been offered the job managing Hog Island team in the Shipyard Soccer League.
*While Tommy Fisher, captain of the New York Ship, is not predicting anything "rash" he says that Bethlehem might strike a surprise when they hook up with his team in the first round match of the cup tourney.
*The many friends of Charles Turner will be sorry to be informed that he died from the influenza. Charles was assistant trainer of the Merchant Ship Team B, of the Delaware Athletic Association Soccer League and was also connected with the Wanderers when that team was a power in soccer last season.

* BETHLEHEM STEEL SOCCER TEAM MAY GO TO PACIFIC COAST
* http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl112518b.html
*If the plans materialize, the Bethlehem F. C., will go through the most extensive season in the history of association football. It is announced that the Steel Workers have accepted an invitation from the California Football Association to play in intersectional series of five games on the Pacific coast, the series to be decided during the Christmas holidays or early in January. This will be their first appearance of the Eastern players west of Kansas City. Arrangements are also being made to play at El Paso, Dallas, St. Louis and Detroit on the return trip.
* The game in California would bring the Steel Workers in conflict with the team representing the Union Iron Works, a subsidiary of the Bethlehem Steel Company. The Steel Workers have attained the title of undisputed champions of the United States, but this is disputed somewhat by the Western clubs due to the fact that the strong Eastern teams have never appeared in an inter-sectional contest.
* While these games loom up as an important event, probably the most important is the visit of Bethlehem club to Ontario, Canada, for a return engagement with the pick of the Canadian team they defeated at Newark, N. J., Sunday a week ago. Canada is all agog over the forthcoming game and it is expected that the proceeds will establish a record for the Dominion. The Mayor of the city is taking a keen interest and it is expected that the city will give the Bethlehem players a civic reception. Those responsible for the team that will meet Bethlehem have made many changes in the lineup since the defeat at Newark. New men are Campbell, Brownlee, Barron, Herring and Walker. The pitch on which the game will be played is within a model enclosure called the "Varsity Stadium" and is as level as a billiard table and the grass like a bowling green.

*Not the National but the American Cup will be at state when the Bethlehem Steel Champions clash with the New York Ship soccer team on Saturday afternoon, on the Bethlehem Steel athletic field, in the first round of the American Cup Competition. This will be the second meeting between these clubs, Bethlehem having ably defended the title of champion by conquering the brawny shipbuilders.
*A victory over New York Ship on Saturday afternoon will mean that the Bethlehem team has thus far this season successfully defended its title in the three organizations in which it is represented. With Fred Pepper and Harry Ratican again back into harness, the Steel Workers are more confident than ever of again downing the New York Shipbuilders.
*Accorinding to Manager George Bowe, of the New Yorkers, his contention is that the Shipbuilders profited by the defeat at the hands of Bethlehem and that he is now more confident of victory than ever.
*"Dick" Spaulding, the former Victor and Disstons' left fullback, will again make the trip and will partner Aleck McLaughlin, his former teammate in the fullback position. Owing to "Bart" McGhee, the speedy outside left having left the New York Ship, it is likely that he will not assist his former team, though he is still the property of the Camden club.
*Manager William Sheridan has returned from Newark, N. J., where he attended the meeting of the New Jersey Football Association. Manager Sheridan is a member of the executive committee of that body and was summoned to the meeting yesterday afternoon.

* According to an announcement appearing in a Philadelphia paper, the Steel Workers are still contemplating the trip to California during the Christmas holidays, in addition to playing a team compried of the pick of the Delaware Shipyard League, sandwiched in with the regular playing schedule.


* http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl120618.html
*Report has it hat Tommy Swords, center forward of the New York Ship, has gone back to Fall River, Mass., where he resided before signing with the shipbuilders. Swords is one of the most feared players in the game and his loss would be a serious setback to a team. “Tommy” however may be here with the shipbuilders tomorrow. He is signed with Manager Bowe’s squad and cannot play with any other team. Even if he did quit work at the plant he is eligible to continue to play with the Camden crowd and may come on purposely to get another chance against the Bethlehem players.


*http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl120718.html
*An announcement believed to have emanated from Thomas W. Cahill, secretary of the United States Football Association, states that the Bethlehem Soccer Football Club, through its manager, H. Edgar Lewis, vice president of the Bethlehem Steel Works, has accepted the challenge of the Union Shipyard team, of San Francisco, to play the Union eleven out on the Pacific coast. Locally, it is understood that all details have not been definitely arranged although it is thoroughly believed that the contemplated trip will be made due to the wonderful showing made by the team this season and to dispose of whatever dispute might arise relative to the merits on which the Bethlehem F. C. attained the honor of United States champions. The article in which reference is made to the trip read:
*“Since the Bethlehem team captured the National and American cups, which gives them undisputed honors as champions, the Coast team has been dickering for a game for the titular honors of America.
*“The Bethlehem players will leave Bethlehem, Pa., Dec. 20. Thomas W. Cahill, secretary of the United States Football Association, will accompany the team as the representative of the U.S.F.A. Cahill was the first American to represent this country in soccer football at a meeting of the International Football Association in England and he also was the first American to take an American soccer team to Europe. He is now working with Mr. Lewis in perfecting plans for a tour for the Bethlehem players after playing the Union Shipyard team for the championship of the United States.
*“It has already been decided not to play any games on the way to the coast, so that the players will not run the risk of being injured. While no date has been set for the contest with the Union team, it is believed that word will be received early next week from James Tynan, president of the California Football Association, which is representing the Union team in arranging for the game with the U.S.F.A. On the return trip the Bethlehem team will play exhibition games in Los Angeles, Dallas, St. Louis and Pittsburgh, Pa. Other games may be arranged.
*“As this is the first time in the history of soccer football in this country that an Eastern team has toured the Pacific coast, more than usual interest is attached to the coming tour. Bethlehem is one of the strongest elevens ever gotten together in this country and as the team is really stronger than last year when they captured the National and American cups, it is expected that they will prove too strong for the Union Shipyard eleven which his made up of players who are considered without peer in America.


*http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/gl120918.html
The trip to California is practically a certainly, according to one of the officials of the team. However, many details are still to be adjusted, mainly, the financial end of such a trip. It is believed that the expense of taking the Steel Workers to California will total in the neighborhood of $6,000 and guarantees for this amount must be assured.

*The soccer touring bug has now infected the Merchant A team and announcement is made that William T. Wilson, president of the Merchant Shipyard Athletic Association is completing arrangements for this team to tour St. Louis and Chicago during the Christmas and New Year holiday. It is planned for the team to play three games at St. Louis and probably two in Chicago, while they will also arrange one or more games before coming East. Negotiations are also being made to tour Buffalo, New York and Canada later in the season.
*Bethlehem is also slated for a trip during the holiday season and with the Merchants also gone, the East will be deprived of the two strongest teams in the country. In billing themselves as ranking among the best playing outfits gathered together it would be no surprised to see placards announcing their coming flared in the biggest print possible – “The Team That Forced Bethlehem to Two Fifteen-Minute Extra Periods Before Being Defeated by 3 Goals to 2.”

* Billy Kirkpatrick, a former Bethlehem soccer idol, will shortly be sporting the colors of the Merchant B Shipbuilders' team, according to reports reaching here from Philadelphia. It is understood that Kirkpatrick has already started work as a shipbuilder and the likelihood is that on him will rest the responsibility of winning the honors in the Delaware Shipyard League. While his going is regretted, Manager Sheridan has at his disposal several reserve players who can capably handle the former Bethlehem star's position. Hopes were entertained that a reconciliation might be effected between Kirkpatrick and the Bethlehem management and that after he carefully considered his action he would return to the Bethlehem fold. Billy, however, apparently is determined that he is through with the local crowd. His action in leaving here is attributed to a little rumpus he had with Manager Sheridan when denied the privilege of accompanying the team on a trip for an exhibition game. It is understood that he refused to report for training wand when the list of players to make the trip was announced and his name was omitted, he became highly indignant and declared that if he was not included, he was through. His name was not included and now he is seeking laurels in the shipbuilders' circuit. Kirkpatrick has since secured his release from Bethlehem and is employed at the Harriman ship plant. The fact that he played for Bethlehem in the National and American Cup series renders him ineligible to play with Merchant A in their semi-final American Cup game. He will, however, be a big aid to the B team in its effort to win the Shipyard League championship. In commenting on the matter, Manager Sheridan stated that it was in justice to the other players that Kirkpatrick was benched for the game in question. He further stated that the other players reported for practice promptly and regularly and had he given in to Billy his actions might have caused dissension among the players.

*Looks as if Merchant Team A has secured a classy center forward in "Laddie" MacCabe, who hails from Buffalo, N. Y. This lad seemed to have the goods in the benefit match at Shibe Park and should greatly strengthen the front line in the National and American Cup matches.
Bethlehem could not be blamed in the least for protesting MacCabe, had he played against them for Merchants last Saturday. The rule distinctly states that a player to be eligible for the National Cup competition must be signed at least fourteen days prior to playing.
*Manager Bowe appears to have hit upon the right combination in the forward line with Tommy Swords at center. Looks as if the New Yorkers will take some beating for the bunting with their present lineup in the Shipyard Soccer series.
*That was the nearest shave last Saturday the Bethlehemites have had for some time in a National Cup match. At one part of the game it looked as if the honors this season were going to be distributed better than last year, when the up-staters won both the National and American cups.
